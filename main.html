				Technology is one of the most prominent things that most contemporary people have at their disposal in our modern era. Nowadays, technology governs everything, from our houses to a degree, ourselves. Technology has an impact on how people interact, learn, and think. It benefits society and influences how individuals connect with one another on a regular basis. Today, technology plays a vital role in society. It has both beneficial and bad consequences on the planet and has an influence on people's everyday lives. We live in a time where technical developments are prevalent. Cell phones and the internet are two examples. However, like with all technical improvements, there is a drawback.

				How technology influences learning is one component of technology that has had a significant effect on society. It has made learning more dynamic and collaborative, allowing individuals to better engage with the topics they are studying and having difficulty with. It also improves your access to resources. With the invention of the internet, we now have access to knowledge 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and you can find practically anything online. Furthermore, it makes it easy for pupils to complete their assignments. Students can take quizzes and examinations more readily, and professors may organize extremely effective online courses. It also broadens the scope of the classroom by promoting self-paced study. People may learn through YouTube and other social media platforms. This is more beneficial to students' learning than sitting through lectures and reading from textbooks. Learning has become more enjoyable and easy as a result of technology improvements.
				<br />
				<br />
				Another way technology has influenced society is via communication, namely how people converse and interact with one another throughout the globe. Many new electronic communication techniques have emerged as a result of technological advancements. For example, there are emails, social networking, the ability to facetime someone on the other side of the planet, and video conferencing, which allows you to have conferences online. Finally, technical improvements in the health profession have helped to keep people safe and healthy. There are several inventive applications on phones that enable users to monitor their weight, calorie consumption, heart rate, and other health features at any time of day. There is enhanced treatment accessibility, a shift in healthcare that includes benefits for the aged, and hospitals that use modern technology in their operating rooms.

				Empowerment technology is a fantastic topic for students like myself to study and comprehend more while also socializing. Technology is simple to use and provides speedier information; it is often used in schooling. As a student, I realized that Empowerment Technology was teaching us how to use technology. Technology teaches us how to be more responsible in utilizing it for good intentions, which is education.
				<br />
				<br />
				In my experience, this topic is a lot of fun because of the investigation that I performed. I investigate the components of Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint presentations, and Word Processing. This topic helps me improve my computer and internet abilities. Empowerment technology is critical for assisting us in preparing, teaching us value, and introducing us to the proper world of ICT (Information Communication Technology), as well as teaching us the proper etiquette of using it and not the way in which people use it in violent ways that could endanger someone's life. But we must be responsible in enabling technology since it is up to us how we manage utilizing it, therefore I hope in this lesson we will expand our minds on how to be responsible in empowering technologies. Always consider if this item would damage or improve your life.
